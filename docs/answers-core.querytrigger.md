## QueryTrigger enum

Indicates what triggered the search.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum QueryTrigger 
```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  Initialize | <code>&quot;initialize&quot;</code> | Indicates that the query was triggered by a default initial search. |

## Remarks

Used for search analytics. If a user initiated a search, do not supply a QueryTrigger.

## Example

An answers site may be configured to perform a search for 'What services do you offer?' when the page loads. Because that query is a default query rather than a user-suppied query, the Initialize QueryTrigger should be supplied in the request. If a user were to manually type a query, then a QueryTrigger should not be supplied in the request.
