## AnswersCore.filterAutocomplete() method

Performs an autocomplete request against specified fields within a single vertical.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
filterAutocomplete(request: FilterAutocompleteRequest): Promise<FilterAutocompleteResponse>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  request | [FilterAutocompleteRequest](./answers-core.filterautocompleterequest.md) | Filter autocomplete request options |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[FilterAutocompleteResponse](./answers-core.filterautocompleteresponse.md)<!-- -->&gt;

## Remarks

This differs from the vertical autocomplete because the vertical autocomplete operates on all entity fields whereas filter autocomplete operates only on specified fields. If rejected, the reason will be an [AnswersError](./answers-core.answerserror.md)<!-- -->.

## Example

A site has a 'products' vertical and would like a way to allow the user to narrow down the results by the product name. The site can add a second search bar powered by filter autocomplete which will include only product names as search suggestions.
