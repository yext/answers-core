## AnswersCore.filterAutoComplete() method

Performs an autocomplete request against specified fields within a single vertical.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
filterAutoComplete(request: FilterAutoCompleteRequest): Promise<FilterAutoCompleteResponse>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  request | [FilterAutoCompleteRequest](./answers-core.filterautocompleterequest.md) | Filter autocomplete request options |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[FilterAutoCompleteResponse](./answers-core.filterautocompleteresponse.md)<!-- -->&gt;

## Remarks

This differs from the vertical autocomplete because the vertical autocomplete operates on all entity fields whereas filter autocomplete operates only on specified fields.

## Example

A site has a 'products' vertical and would like a way to allow the user to narrow down the results by the product name. The site can add a second search bar powered by filter autocomplete which will include only product names as search suggestions.
