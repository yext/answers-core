## SearchCore.filterSearch() method

Performs a filtersearch request against specified fields within a single vertical.

**Signature:**

```typescript
filterSearch(request: FilterSearchRequest): Promise<FilterSearchResponse>;
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[FilterSearchResponse](./search-core.filtersearchresponse.md)<!-- -->&gt;

## Remarks

This differs from the vertical autocomplete because the vertical autocomplete operates on all entity fields whereas filtersearch operates only on specified fields. If rejected, the reason will be an [SearchError](./search-core.searcherror.md)<!-- -->.

## Example

A site has a 'products' vertical and would like a way to allow the user to narrow down the results by the product name. The site can add a second search bar powered by filtersearch which will include only product names as search suggestions.
